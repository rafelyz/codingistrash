        W Interiors is a Wayne family business that was<br>
        established in 2016 after recognising a gap in <br>
         the market for high-quality coloured fixtures. <br>
        With expertise in high-end renovations, our <br>
        founders initially set out to sell renovation  <br>
        packages to help streamline the selection and  <br>
        building process. After discovering a lack of local  <br>
        access to high-quality architectural products,  <br>
        particularly coloured tapware, they combined their  <br>
        diverse retail, architecture, and property <br>
        development backgrounds to create a solution.

        The vision was to empower homeowners and trades by <br>
          providing premium, coloured kitchen and bathroom <br>
        products at an inclusive price point â€” thus <br>conceptualising the start of W Interiors.
        <br><br><br>
        We shifted into the e-commerce sphere, scaling the business by <br>
        creating greater accessibility for customers worldwide.<br>   
    We continuously aim to facilitate wider access to our products as we <br>
    understand the importance of a tactile experience before purchasing.<br>
    For that reason, we have set up two additional showrooms in the 
    <br> United Kingdom and New Zealand, with more on the way. <br><br><br>
    Today, we are globally recognised for our signature finishes of brushed brass,<br>
     brushed copper, brushed nickel, brushed gunmetal, matte black, and white.<br><br><br>
     <b>We pride ourselves on being a comprehensive supplier for any project needs <br>
        and are dedicated to creating innovative products of exemplary quality.</b>
